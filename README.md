# react-native-filesystem
Simple file system API for iOS &amp; Android, for dealing with text-files.

All interaction is promise-based, and all content is 
written and read as UTF-8.

This library is still under development, and only works on iOS at the current moment.

## Setup

    npm install react-native-filesystem --save
    react-native link react-native-filesystem

## Usage
### Write to files

```javascript
import FileSystem from 'react-native-filesystem';

async function writeFile() {
  const fileContents = 'This is a my content.';
  await FileSystem.writeToFile('my-directory/my-file.txt', fileContents);
  console.log('file is written');
}
```

Sub-directories are created automatically.

### Read from files

```javascript
async function readFile() {
  const fileContents = await FileSystem.readFile('my-directory/my-file.txt');
  console.log(`read from file: ${fileContents}`);
}
```

### Delete files or folders

```javascript
async function deleteFile() {
  await FileSystem.delete('my-directory/my-file.txt');
  console.log('file is deleted');
}
```

### Check if files or directories exist

```javascript
async function checkIfFileExists() {
  const fileExists = await FileSystem.fileExists('my-directory/my-file.txt');
  const directoryExists = await FileSystem.fileExists('my-directory/my-file.txt');
  console.log(`file exists: ${fileExists}`);
  console.log(`directory exists: ${directoryExists}`);
}
```

### Selecting storage class

All commands also take an optional last argument specifying a storage class. 
These classes roughly correspond to the four points of the 
[iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/index.html), 
and have similar behaviour on Android. Example usage:

```javascript
FileSystem.writeToFile('my-file.txt', 'My content', FileSystem.storage.important);
```

Files need to be read from the same storage class they're saved to, and two files can have the same name 
if they're located in different storages. The options are:

#### storage.backedUp

The default. Files stored in this location will automatically be backed up by iCloud on iOS and [Auto Backup for Apps](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup.html) on Android. This is generally for user-generated content that cannot be re-generated / re-downloaded.

Corresponds to `<Application_Home>/Documents` on iOS and [Context.getFilesDir()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getFilesDir()) on Android.

#### storage.important

This is for files that are possible to re-generate / re-download, but are still important to keep around. F.ex. offline maps.

Corresponds to `<Application_Home>/<Application_Home>/Library/Caches` with "do not backup" flag on iOS and [Context.getNoBackupFilesDir()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getNoBackupFilesDir()) on Android.

#### storage.auxiliary

This storage class is for files that can be re-created, and are not crucial to the proper functioning of your app.

Corresponds to `<Application_Home>/<Application_Home>/Library/Caches` on iOS and [Context.getExternalCacheDir()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getExternalCacheDir()) on Android.

#### storage.temporary

Location for temporary caches and data. You should still clean up / delete the files when they are no longer in use.

Corresponds to `<Application_Home>/tmp` on iOS and [Context.getCacheDir()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getCacheDir()) on Android.

## Questions?

*Why yet another file system library?*

I simply couldn't find one that satisfied my basic needs for simplicity.

*Why not use the built-in AsyncStorage?*

[AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html) is fine, but some 
times you want more control as to where the content is stored. This library lets you put it 
in backed-up folders, or play nice by marking content that can be deleted when the 
 phone runs low on space.
